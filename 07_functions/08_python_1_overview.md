That was a lot, so well done!! 

Let's go through everything we've done in this chapter:

  - We learned about functions.
  - We learned about built-in functios.
 - We learned about importing.
 - We created a `main()` function.
 - We turned the welcome message into a function.
 - We created a function that generates a random word each time you start playing the game.
