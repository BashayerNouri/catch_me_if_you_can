Logical operators are the `and`, `or`, `not` operators.

Logical operators compares between two booleans and returns a boolean as a result.

-   `and`  checks if both the statements are  `True`

-   `or`  checks if at least one of the statements is  `True`
-   `not`  gives the opposite of the statement.
