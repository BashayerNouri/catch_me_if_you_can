In python. The `input()` function allows user input.

This line of code will display a message prompting the user for input. The program will stop at this point until the user writes his input and presses  `enter`. After that, That input will be saved in the variable.


***For example:***
```python
# Python program showing the use of input()
name  =  input("Enter your name: ") 
print('Hello, ' + name)
```
***Output***
```
Enter your name: Bashayer
Hello, Bashayer
```

<br>

***Note:*** Do keep in mind that `input()` always saves a string. If the user enters 4, it will be saved in the variable as the string "4".

## Python String `lower()` Method
The `lower()` method returns a string where all characters are lower case.

Let's edit the previous example.

```python
# returns name input characters into lower case
name  =  input("Enter your name: ").lower() 
print('Hello, ' + name)
```
***Output***
```
Enter your name: BASHAYER
Hello, Bashayer
```
