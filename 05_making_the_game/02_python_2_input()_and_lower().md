Before jumping into our code and explaining what we are trying to build next, you need to understand some concepts first.

---

In python. The `input()` function allows user input.

***For example:***
```python
# Python program showing the use of input()
name  =  input("Enter your name: ") 
print('Hello, ' + name)
```

This line of code will display a message prompting the user for input. The program will stop at this point until the user writes his input and presses  `enter`. After that, That input will be saved in the variable called `name`.



***Output:***

<br>

***Note:*** Do keep in mind that `input()` always saves a string. If the user enters 4, it will be saved in the variable as the string "4".

## Python String `lower()` Method
The `lower()` method returns a string where all characters are lower case.

Let's edit the previous example and add a `lower()` method.

***For example:***
```python
# returns input characters into lower case
name  =  input("Enter your name: ").lower() 
print('Hello, ' + name)
```
***Output:***

Now before going into the next section. Open your ```script.py``` file and practice. 

***To run the file:***

    $ cd catch-me-if-you-can
    $ python script.py
    
You can also play with this with your family and friends!
