## What are operators in python?

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

You can do any arithemetic operation in python such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

***For example:***

```python
add = 6 + 89
sub = 44 - 8
mult = 5 * 5
div = 9/9

print(add)
print(sub)
print(mult)
print(div)

```

***Output:***
```
>>> 95
>>> 36
>>> 25
>>> 1
```

----

We also have shortcuts for writing operators.

So this:

```python
number = 4
number = number + 1

print(number)
```

***Output:***
```
>>> 5
```
Can also be written like this:

```python
number = 4
number += 1

print(number)
```

***Output:***
```
>>> 5
```
