That was a lot, so well done!! 

Let's go through everything we've done in this chapter:

 - We learned about the `input()` function.
 - We learned about the `lower()` method.
 - We learned about comparators.
 - We learned about logical operators.
 - We learned about conditional statement.
 - We learned about `for` loop.
 - We learned about  how to `print` a `for` loop.
 - We learned about `while` loop.
 - We learned about arithmetic.


Make sure that it's working properly and the correct information is showing.
