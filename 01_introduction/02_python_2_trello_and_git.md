In this project you'll be using both  `trello`  and  `git`.

#### Trello

`Trello`  is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What you need to do...what you've already finished and so on.

Open the projects  `Trello`  board which you'll find in the  `Resources`  section. 

**In the board you'll find 4 lists:**

-   `IceBox`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
-   `Backlog`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that we need to do.
-   `Doing`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you are currently working on.
-   `Done`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that are done.

Right now all the cards are in the  `backlog`  list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working in this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.

Before you can move the cards, you need to copy the board into your account. This'll help you figure out how to do that  [copying boards](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards). Go to the "Boards" section.

**For a summary. you need to:**
1.  Open the  "`Show Menu`"  on the right corner of the screen
2.  Click "`More`"
3.  Click "`Copy Board`"
4.  Add a title "`Catch Me If You Can`"
5.  Click "`Create`"

Now you have your own copy of the board, you can move, change, add or delete cards. You can do whatever you like! Take a look at it.

#### `Trello` Card Description  

Make sure to check if the card contains a description or not, as it may help you understand what we are trying to build more. If the card contains a description it will have this icon ![icon](https://i.ibb.co/FqdJW02/icon.png):

#### Git

We'll be using git throughout the project to keep track of the changes we're making to the code and create checkpoints everytime we finish a functionality.

You can start by forking and cloning the following repo on [github](https://github.com/BashayerNouri/catch-me-if-you-can) to start your project setup. 

**In the next sections you'll learn how to do that.**
