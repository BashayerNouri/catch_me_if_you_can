You don't have to be a programmer or familiar with any programming languages to build this project, you will learn the basics of python step by step with easy and simple codes.

Also, Instead of trying to deliver it all at once, we going to use `Trello` and `Git` to build it feature by feature and keep track of the changes along the
way.


**What will you use during this project:**

 - `Python:` For developing the game.
 - `Trello:` a list-making application to keep track of your work.
 - `Command Prompt/Terminal:` Basic usage of the Terminal commands.
 - `Git:` a version-control system for tracking the changes we're making
   to the code.
 

So are you excited? Let's gooooo.
