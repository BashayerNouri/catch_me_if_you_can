Let's go through everything we've done in this chapter:

- We learned about the `print()` function.
- We learned how to `print()` different data types.
- We learned how to write a comment.
- We finished the welcome message program.

Make sure that it's working properly and the correct information is showing. If all is good, move the card and push the code.
