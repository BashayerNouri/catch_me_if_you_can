Now what we’re going to do is teach our computer to communicate. The gift of speech is valuable, a computer can answer many questions we have about “how” or “why” or “what” it is doing. In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to talk. The message to be printed should be surrounded by quotes.


For example, if you want to print the following in you console:

```
Hello, World!
```


You should write the following in your Python file:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
or
```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

In Python a string is either surrounded by double quotes (`"Hello, World!"`) or single quotes (`'Hello, World!'`). It doesn’t matter which kind you use, just be consistent.
