So now, let's write our first Python program in the game.

Find the `catch-me-if-you-can/catch_me_if_you_can.py` file, and add the following without running your code:

```python
print("Welcome to Catch Me If You Can")
```
So can you guess what will be printed out on your console? Stop, and think about it.

Are you ready?

In the above example, we direct our program to `print()` a welcome message. The printed words that appear as a result of the `print()` function are referred to as _output_. 

***The output would be:***

```
Welcome to Catch Me If You Can
```

---

Now, we want to add more messages to our program. 

Find the `catch-me-if-you-can/catch_me_if_you_can.py` file. Print the following messages with a break between each message using the `print()` command, `save` the file and then `run` your python code to test it out.

***Output***
```
Welcome to Catch Me If You Can
Get ready
Starting the game...
Selecting a word...
```

***To run the file:***

    $ cd catch-me-if-you-can
    $ python catch_me_if_you_can.py
   
   <br>
Think about it, how can we print multiple messages with a break between each message?

Play with your code and try to `print` the messages above.

So are you ready?

Let's start....

We can print the above messages using one of the following:

Find the `catch-me-if-you-can/catch_me_if_you_can.py` file, and add one of the following:


```python
# A welcome message
print()
print("Welcome to Catch Me If You Can")
print("Get ready")
print("Starting the game...")
print("Selecting a word...")
```
**Or:**
```python
# A welcome message
print("""
Welcome to Catch Me If You Can
Get ready
Starting the game...
Selecting a word...
""")
```

And that's it we are done!!! Happy Dance.
