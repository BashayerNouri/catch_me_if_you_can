So now let's write our first Python program.

Find the `catch-me-if-you-can/catch_me_if_you_can.py` file, and add the following without running your code:

```python
print("Welcome to Catch Me If You Can")
```
So can you guess what will be printed out on your console? Stop, and think about it.

Are you ready?

1..

2..

3..

In the above example, we direct our program to `print()` a welcome message. The printed words that appear as a result of the `print()` function are referred to as _output_. The output of this example program would be:

```
Welcome to Catch Me If You Can
```

---

Now, we want to add more messages to our file. 

Your next job is to `print()` the following messages with a break between each message like this:

```
Welcome to Catch Me If You Can
Get ready
Starting the game...
Selecting a word...
```

Think about it, how can we print multiple messages with a break between each message?

Play with your code and try to `print` the messages above.

Now, we can print the above messages using one of the following:

Find the `catch-me-if-you-can/catch_me_if_you_can.py` file, and add one of the following:


```python
print("Welcome to Catch Me If You Can")
print("Get ready")
print("Starting the game...")
print("Selecting a word...")
```
**Or:**
```python
print("""
Welcome to Catch Me If You Can
Get ready
Starting the game...
Selecting a word...
""")
```

And that's it we are done!!! Happy Dance.
