In this chapter, you'll add difficulty levels to your game.

Right now we have 10 tries/attempts fixed, so let's make it more fun and specify the number of attempts based on the player level selection.

**The difficulty levels are:**

>  Easy (10 attempts) 
>  Intermediate (6 attempts) 
>  Difficult (2 attempts)

Sounds fun right? Let's get started.
