In the `main()` function, add the following code:

```python
def main():

    letters_guessed = []
    guessed = False

    # The player has 10 tries at the beginning of the game. 
    tries = 10

    weclcome_message()

    print("\nThe word contains", len(random_word), 'letters. \n')
    print(len(random_word) * (" _"))
    
    while guessed == False and tries > 0:
            print("\nYou have %s tries." % tries)
            guess = input("\nEnter one letter or the full word: ").lower()

            if len(guess) == 1:
                if not guess.isalpha():
                    print("\n\'%s\' is not a letter, enter a letter!\n" % guess)
                    print("\nLetters Guessed: %s\n" % letters_guessed)

                elif guess in letters_guessed:
                    print("\n\'%s\' has been guessed before, try another letter.\n" % guess)
                    print("\nLetters Guessed: %s\n" % letters_guessed)

                elif guess not in random_word:
                    print("\n\'%s\' is not part of the word, try another letter.\n" % guess)
                    letters_guessed.append(guess)
                    tries -=1
                    print("\nLetters Guessed: %s\n" % letters_guessed)

                elif guess in random_word:
                    print("\nWell done, that letter exists in the word!\n")
                    letters_guessed.append(guess)
                    print("\nLetters Guessed: %s\n" % letters_guessed)

            elif len(guess) == len(random_word):
                if guess == random_word:
                    print(picture[1])
                    print("\nCongratulations! the word is \"%s\"" % random_word)
                    guessed = True

                else:
                    print("\nSomething is not part of the word, try again.\n")
                    tries -=1
```


 **We added the following:**
 
```python
else:
   print("\nSomething is not part of the word, try again.\n")
   tries -=1
```


 - If the player entered a **full word** and it is length is equal to the length of the random word:

    **If the word is wrong:**
   - `print` "Something is not part of the word"
    - minimize `tries` by one.
