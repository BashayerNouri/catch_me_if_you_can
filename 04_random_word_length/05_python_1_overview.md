Let's go through everything we've done in this chapter:

- We learned about variables.
- We learned how to `print()` variables.
- We learned about string formatting.
- We learned about the `len()` function.
- We learned about escape characters.
- We finished our program.

This was a very straight forward. Make sure that it's working properly and the correct information is showing. If all is good, move the card and push the code.
