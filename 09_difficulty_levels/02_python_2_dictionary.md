Before jumping into building the difficulty levels, you need to understand some concepts first.


## What is dictionary in Python?

Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. While other compound data types have only value as an element, a dictionary has a `key: value` pair.



## How to create a dictionary?

Creating a dictionary is as simple as placing items inside curly braces `{}` separated by comma.

An item has a `key` and the corresponding `value` expressed as a pair, `key: value`.


***Example:***

```python
# dictionary with keys and values
level = { 
    "easy": 10,
    "intermediate": 6,
    "difficult":  2,
    }
    
print(level)
```

***Output***
```
>>> {'easy': 10, 'intermediate': 6, 'difficult': 2}
```
## How to access elements from a dictionary?

***Example:***
```python
# access elements from a dictionary
level = { 
    "easy": 10,
    "intermediate": 6,
    "difficult":  2,
    }

print(level['intermediate'])
```

***Output***
```
>>> 6
```

Now before going into the next section. Open your ```script.py``` file and practice. 

***To run the file:***

    $ cd catch-me-if-you-can
    $ python script.py
