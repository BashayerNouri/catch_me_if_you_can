How the score is calculated?

**The score is calculated based on the following:**

 - Level number (1, 2 or 3) 
 - Level weight (10, 20 or 30)
 - Length of the random word 
 - Five extra points as a bonus
 

> Score = (level number) * (level weight +  random word length + bonus)

**For more clarification:**

- If the player level is `Easy`, and the random word is ```Guacamole```, the player score will be calculated as follows:

       Score = (1) * (10 + 9 + 5)
       Score =  24

- If the player level is `Intermediate`, and the random word is ```Aladdin```, the player score will be calculated as follows:

      Score = (2) * (20 + 7 + 5)
      Score = 64

- If the player level is `Difficult`, and the random word is ```Piano```, the player score will be calculated as follows:

      Score = (3) * (30 + 5 + 5)
      Score = 120
